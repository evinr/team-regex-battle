# Team Regex Battle
This is a tool used to teach a group how to master regular expressions. By leveraging Web RTC to allow for up to 50 players to try and have the best regex as determined via the browsers performance API.

## TODO's
* Create P2P PoC
* Create Performance API for Regex PoC
* Create Final Team Regex Showdown

## Limitations
Due to the fact that this is runnign on the browser, the machines that this is used by should all be similar in terms of hardware specs. For my usecase everyone on my team was running the same machine. This is not necessarily a limitation as much as a feature, as we may learn that some browsers implementation of the RegExp is more performant than others.
